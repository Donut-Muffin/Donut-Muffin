<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hello my name is <strong>John</strong> and I'm from Ottawa. I like to make HTML websites and Python programs. My timezone is EST and the weather here is quite cold!</p>
<h1>Languages I've coded in before:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>PYTHON</li>
</ul>
<h1>Languages I have limited experience with:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>C++</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
</ul>
<p>I mainly use Python and HTML for most of my projects. I am familiar with several python packages including requests, discord.py, tkinter, PIL (somewhat), pyautogui, pyinstaller and more!</p>
